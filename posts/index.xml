      <description>A friend of mine recently came up with the joke that modern software runs on answers from Stackoverflow and not on AWS. Even though it is obviously an exagerration, I agree that developers sometimes tend to overabuse an opportunity to search for a solution immediately after they have been challenged with a problem or even simply been given a task to implement. As a lazy person programmer I often times do it myself too!</description>
