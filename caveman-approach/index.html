        <p>A friend of mine recently came up with the joke that modern software runs on answers from Stackoverflow and not on AWS. Even though it is obviously an exagerration, I agree that developers sometimes tend to overabuse an opportunity to search for a solution immediately after they have been challenged with a problem or even simply been given a task to implement. As a <del>lazy person</del> programmer I often times do it myself too! Especially when I'm in a rush, or <a href="/resume">at work</a>. I usually have &quot;Oh, I will only need this once&quot; as an excuse to justify the habit. But over time I noticed that I keep <del>Googleing</del> DuckDuckGoing the same solutions over and over again.</p>
<p>To change that pattern a little bit and help my memory get back on track, I recently started applying what I call a &quot;Caveman Approach&quot; to finding a solution to the problem I'm being challenged with. The main idea is to solve your problem as if no one has ever attempted to solve it before, hence there is no sense searching the internet for an answer. I'm beta testing it now mostly on my hobby projects or other less critical stuff, because who has time for experiments at work, right?</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>do not search</strong> for the solution head on, i.e. no obvious search queries</li>
<li>I allocate a timeframe that I want to spend on solving the problem on my own</li>
<li>I break down the problem into as many small pieces as possible and solve one small issue at a time.</li>
<li>I focus on analyzing <em>what</em> needs to be done instead of <em>how</em></li>
<li>Specifications and offical documentation are allowed (if I deal with a programming language problem, or a framework, or a tool/service)</li>
<li>At the end of the allocated timeframe I search for the solution on the internet and compare mine with what I've found</li>
<li>If mine was identical or close to what I've found - I get satisfaction points and some permanent connections between the neurons in my brain</li>
<li>If mine is completely different, I try to see if it is better in any aspect (more readable, more efficient, better maintainable, etc), and based on the trade-offs I either accept mine or theirs</li>
</ul>
<p>Last step is hard to execute objectively, but I think it helps to develop critical thinking skills and question everything (including my own choices)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!<br />
